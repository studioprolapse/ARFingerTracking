# ARKit 3D Box Addition Demo

This repository contains a small demo project that showcases the amazing capabilities of ARKit and Vision frameworks. Inspired by the hand gestures demonstrated at Apple's WWDC23, this project leverages hand pose recognition to seamlessly add 3D boxes into the user's environment.

## Features
- Real-time hand pose recognition using Vision framework
- Integration with ARKit for precise placement and tracking of 3D boxes
- Gesture-based interaction: simply use hand gestures to summon 3D boxes into the real world
- Seamless integration of virtual objects with the physical environment

## Getting Started
To run the demo project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on an ARKit-supported device.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate hand pose recognition.
5. Start adding 3D boxes to your environment using hand gestures.

## Requirements
- Xcode 14 or later
- iOS 16 or later
- ARKit-supported device
